# Spicy Taco Sauce Recipe

## Ingredients

- 1 cup of tomato sauce
- 2 cloves of garlic, minced
- 1/4 cup of diced onions
- 2 tablespoons of olive oil
- 2 teaspoons of chili powder
- 1 teaspoon of cayenne pepper (adjust for desired spice level)
- 1 teaspoon of paprika
- 1/2 teaspoon of cumin
- Salt and black pepper to taste
- 1 tablespoon of lime juice

## Instructions

1. Heat the olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat.

2. Add the minced garlic and diced onions. Saut√© until the onions become translucent, about 2-3 minutes.

3. Stir in the chili powder, cayenne pepper, paprika, cumin, salt, and black pepper. Cook for another 2 minutes to toast the spices and release their flavors.

4. Add the tomato sauce and lime juice to the saucepan. Stir well to combine.

5. Reduce the heat to low and simmer the sauce for about 10-15 minutes, allowing it to thicken and the flavors to meld together. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking.

6. Taste the sauce and adjust the spice level with more cayenne pepper if desired, or add more salt and pepper to taste.

7. Once the sauce reaches your preferred consistency and flavor, remove it from the heat and let it cool slightly.

8. Transfer the spicy taco sauce to a glass jar or airtight container. Store it in the refrigerator for up to two weeks.
